## Photorealistic Scenes

Use photography terminology for realistic images.

**Key elements:**
- Camera angles: wide-angle, close-up, bird's-eye view
- Lens types: 35mm, 85mm portrait lens, wide-angle lens
- Lighting: golden hour, studio lighting, soft diffused light
- Textures: fabric grain, skin detail, surface reflections

**Prompt structure:**
```
shot type → subject → action → environment → lighting → mood → camera specs
```

**Example:**
```
Professional corporate headshot of a confident woman in her 30s, wearing a navy blue blazer. Shot with an 85mm portrait lens at f/1.8 for shallow depth of field. Natural window light from the left creates gentle shadows. High-resolution detail capturing individual strands of hair and fabric texture.
```

## Stylized Illustrations & Stickers

Be explicit about artistic choices.

**Key elements:**
- Artistic style: flat design, watercolor, pixel art, anime style
- Color palette: pastel tones, vibrant neon, monochromatic
- Line style: bold outlines, sketch lines, smooth vectors
- Shading: cel-shaded, gradient shading, no shadows
- Background: transparent background for stickers/design assets

**Example:**
```
Kawaii-style cat sticker design featuring a round, chubby orange tabby cat with oversized head. Simple vector art with bold black outlines and flat color fills. Completely transparent background with thin white border for die-cut vinyl sticker production.
```

## Text Rendering

Clearly specify text elements for logos, posters, and diagrams.

**Key elements:**
- Text content: exact words to display
- Font style: bold sans-serif, elegant script, modern geometric
- Design aesthetic: minimalist logo, vintage poster, tech-forward

**Example:**
```
Modern technology company logo for "NexusAI" featuring clean, geometric sans-serif letterforms in midnight blue. The letter 'N' incorporates a subtle abstract neural network pattern. Transparent background. Professional, trustworthy aesthetic.
```

## Product Mockups

Employ professional photography terminology.

**Key elements:**
- Studio lighting: three-point lighting, rim light, fill light
- Camera angles: 45-degree angle, straight-on, overhead shot
- Surface descriptions: matte finish, glossy reflective, textured
- Ultra-realistic details with sharp focus

**Example:**
```
Premium product photography of a sleek smartphone in matte black at 45-degree angle. Three-point studio lighting with key light from upper left, fill light softening shadows, rim light from behind. Shot with macro lens capturing ultra-sharp detail of aluminum frame edges.
```

---

## Minimalist & Negative Space

Design with strategic emptiness for text overlay and clean design.

**Key elements:**
- Position single subjects strategically within frames
- Emphasize vast empty backgrounds
- Follow rule of thirds for balanced composition

**Example:**
```
Minimalist product photograph of a single white coffee mug in lower left third against vast clean white background. Subtle soft shadow to the right. Enormous negative space in upper two-thirds, perfect for text overlay.
```

---

## Sequential Art

Create comic panels or storyboards with consistent style.

**Key elements:**
- Art style specification
- Character descriptions and consistency
- Setting details and environment
- Lighting mood: dramatic shadows, bright daylight
- Text elements: speech bubbles, captions

**Example:**
```
Dynamic comic book panel in classic superhero style. Hero in mid-flight against cityscape. Bold ink outlines with four-color printing aesthetic. Speed lines radiating from center. Speech bubble reads "Not on my watch!" in bold comic lettering. High contrast: deep blues for night sky, bright yellows for city lights.
