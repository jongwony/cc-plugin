person on white background
```

```

**Excellent prompt:**

**Poor prompt:**
```
movie storyboard
```

**Excellent prompt:**
```
Professional film storyboard frame for an action sequence shot. Black and white pencil sketch showing a wide establishing shot of a warehouse interior.

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Multiple Styles

**Poor prompt:**
```
cyberpunk city mixed media
```

**Excellent prompt:**
```
Mixed media artwork combining photorealistic architecture with hand-drawn neon elements, depicting a futuristic Tokyo-inspired cyberpunk street. Base layer is a sharp, photographically realistic concrete and glass building facade. Overlaid are vibrant, illustrated neon signs in pink, cyan, and green with hand-drawn Japanese characters, appearing as if painted with luminous markers. Foreground features realistically rendered rain-slicked pavement reflecting the neon glow. Sky transitions from photographic storm clouds to stylized gradient mesh. This hybrid approach balances technical precision with artistic expression, creating depth through contrasting media styles.
```

### Seasonal Variations

**Poor prompt:**
```
tree in different seasons
```

**Excellent prompt:**
```
Split composition showing the same oak tree across all four seasons in a 2x2 grid layout. Spring (top left): delicate pink and white cherry blossoms, soft pastel morning light. Summer (top right): full lush green canopy, bright warm afternoon sun creating dappled shadows. Autumn (bottom left): vibrant orange and red leaves, golden hour side lighting. Winter (bottom right): bare branches covered in snow, cool blue twilight atmosphere. Each quadrant maintains the same perspective and composition, with only seasonal elements changing. Watercolor illustration style with consistent artistic treatment across all panels. White borders separating each season.
```

### Texture and Material Focus

**Poor prompt:**
```
fabric texture
```

**Excellent prompt:**
```
Extreme macro photography showcasing various fabric textures in a grid composition. Top left: luxurious silk with reflective sheen and subtle ripples catching light. Top right: rough burlap weave showing individual fibers and natural color variation. Bottom left: soft cashmere with fine, fuzzy texture and warm beige tone. Bottom right: technical nylon with precise geometric pattern and slight synthetic sheen. Each fabric sample lit from 45-degree angle to emphasize texture through shadows and highlights. Shot with a macro lens at high magnification, depth of field carefully controlled to keep weave details sharp. Neutral grey background. Educational material quality showing true-to-life material properties.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Generic Results

**Weak prompt:**
```
beautiful landscape
```

**Improved with specificity:**
```
Norwegian fjord landscape at sunrise, steep granite cliffs plunging into mirror-calm turquoise water. Low-angle morning sun creates dramatic side lighting, illuminating patches of snow on distant peaks while keeping foreground in cool blue shadow. Shot with ultra-wide 16mm lens to exaggerate the towering height of the cliffs. Foreground includes mossy rocks and hardy arctic wildflowers adding scale. Atmosphere crystal clear, showing every detail of the striated rock formations. Color palette dominated by cool blues and purples with warm orange accents from sunlit peaks.
```

### Problem: Inconsistent Style

**Mixed style prompt:**
```
photo of cartoon character in realistic setting
```

**Style-consistent approach:**
```
3D rendered cartoon character with exaggerated proportions (large head, big eyes) standing in a photorealistically rendered modern office environment. Character features cel-shaded coloring with bold outlines, maintaining animation aesthetic. Environment uses ray-traced lighting, realistic materials on desk and computer equipment, and accurate physical rendering. This intentional style contrast between character and environment creates a "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" effect. Character casts realistic shadow on the photographic-quality floor, grounding them in the space while maintaining distinct visual styles.
```

### Problem: Unclear Composition

**Vague prompt:**
```
person and dog
```

**Composition-focused prompt:**
```
Wide-angle environmental portrait using rule of thirds composition. Young woman and golden retriever positioned in the right third of frame, both looking toward the left where vast open meadow fills the remaining two-thirds. Subjects in foreground at eye-level perspective create intimate connection with viewer while the sweeping landscape provides context and breathing room. Golden hour backlight creates rim lighting on woman's hair and dog's fur. Shallow depth of field (f/2.8) keeps subjects sharp while gently blurring distant treeline. Leading lines from meadow grass create natural flow toward subjects.
```

## Iteration Examples

### First Generation

**Initial prompt:**
```
Coffee shop interior
```

**Result feedback:** Too generic, lacks atmosphere

### Second Generation (Adding details)

**Refined prompt:**
```
Cozy independent coffee shop interior with warm Edison bulb lighting hanging from exposed wooden ceiling beams. Mismatched vintage furniture including leather armchairs and reclaimed wood tables. Barista counter with professional espresso machine in background. Natural light streaming through large front windows. Plants on shelves.
```

**Result feedback:** Better, but lacks specific mood and perspective

### Third Generation (Perfecting the prompt)

**Final prompt:**
```
Inviting independent coffee shop interior captured from customer's perspective seated at a corner table. Warm, amber Edison bulbs suspended from dark stained wooden ceiling beams create pools of intimate lighting. Foreground shows a ceramic coffee mug on reclaimed barn wood table surface, steam rising. Mid-ground features mismatched vintage furniture: a worn leather armchair and velvet couch in jewel tones. Background barista counter with gleaming copper espresso machine catches light. Late afternoon sun streams through tall front windows with muntins, creating geometric shadow patterns on exposed brick walls. Lush potted plants (fiddle leaf fig, pothos) on floating wooden shelves. Atmospheric, hygge aesthetic. Shot with 35mm lens at f/1.8 for natural depth of field.
```

**Result:** Achieves the desired cozy, specific atmosphere with clear point of view

## Cultural and Context Considerations

### Architecture Styles
When requesting specific architectural styles, be precise:
- "Brutalist concrete building with repetitive geometric patterns" not just "modern building"
- "Victorian-era Gothic Revival church with pointed arches and flying buttresses" not just "old church"
- "Japanese traditional machiya townhouse with wooden lattice and tile roof" not just "Asian house"

### Fashion and Era Specificity
For period-accurate clothing:
- "1960s mod fashion: A-line mini dress in geometric print, white go-go boots, bold eyeliner"
- "Victorian Edwardian era: High-necked lace blouse, floor-length skirt, upswept hair"
- "1980s power dressing: Oversized shoulder pad blazer, high-waist trousers, statement jewelry"

### Cultural Elements
When incorporating cultural elements, research and specify:
- "Traditional Moroccan geometric zellige tile work in cobalt blue and white"
- "Scandinavian mid-century modern design: clean lines, teak wood, muted earth tones"
- "Art Deco style: Symmetrical geometric patterns, gold and black color scheme, sunburst motifs"

## Final Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow:** Begin with overall composition and style, then add specific details
2. **Use sensory language:** Describe how things feel, not just how they look
3. **Reference real examples:** "Lit like a Vermeer painting" or "composed like National Geographic photography"
4. **Consider the viewer:** Where is their eye drawn first? What journey does the composition create?
5. **Think in layers:** Foreground, midground, background—what's in each?
6. **Specify relationships:** How do elements interact? What creates visual hierarchy?
7. **Edit ruthlessly:** Remove generic adjectives ("beautiful," "nice") in favor of specific descriptors
